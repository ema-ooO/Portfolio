   </h3>
   <p> John, the protagonist of the book, becomes the president of a large corporation, and soon after returning to his hometown, his family is killed in a car accident, and he is so discouraged that he contemplates committing suicide.<br>
   However, when his friend Bill suggested that he become a Little League coach, he met Timothy.
   Timothy is not as tall as other kids his age, and he is not very good at baseball.<br>
   So John gives him special coaching. As a result of this special relationship with Timothy, John is no longer suicidal, and he begins to think positively about his life.<br>
   Also, the words that Timothy hears from Dr. Messenger and used to support the team are very thoughtful and impressive.<br>
   The first is, "Every day, every day, in every way, we're getting better and better. <br>
   Timothy said this to John when John was teaching him baseball and he was not improving. I think these words can only be said by Timothy who has continued to work hard.<br>
   The second is, "I will never, never, never, never, never, never give up. <br>
   Even when he couldn't improve in practice, he chanted these words and never gave up.<br>
   Even if Timothy couldn't get a hit until the very end of the game, his teammates would shout these words and cheer him on every time he stepped into the batter's box.<br> Timothy also shouted the words loudest and continued to cheer for his teammates.<br>
   And just as he had said, Timothy never gave up until the very end.

  <p> I chose this book because I’m not good at Physics so, I wanted to read a fun book that I could understand easily<br>
  I learned that The fact that the things we think about without thinking about them are actually related to physics<br>
  For example, it was interesting to find out why ski jumpers can land without dying, or why we can hear distant sounds at night.

   </h3>
   <p> I chose this book because This manga is my most favorite. Also, the story had an impact on me. <br>
   The reason why I recommend this book is because in this book, we can read about family love, how we study, how dreams come true, and adolescents in high school in Japan. <br>
   So, I recommend it to anyone who wants to read heartwarming stories, learn how to study, be encouraged, and feel adolescent. </p>
