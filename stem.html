   <p id="com" class="stem"> STEM Progect is a free research that is about STEM subjects. For example I'm interested in medical so, this year I research about Bone Conduction.</p>

  <!--content2-->
  <br><h2>What I did?</h2>
  <p class="sbox"> I was interested in the mechanism of bone conduction, which I’ve been hearing a lot about lately. Also, I’m interested in bone conduction hearing aids because my grandmother’s hearing is getting worse, so I want to know about bone conduction and I want to help my grandmother.<br>
  Therfore I did two experiment.
 </p><br>

<!--content3-->  
  <h2>First Experiment</h2>
  <div class="ex">
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p class="sbox"> To research whether anyone can feel bone conduction and when you use a bone conduction device, where is the best placement on the head to use it? </p><br>

  <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
  <p class="sbox">Just in front of one’s ears, one can hear the sound clearest and loudest because the mechanism of bone conduction is hearing sounds by directly shaking the inner ear.</p><br>

  <h3>Methods</h3>
  <section class="sbox">
  <p><span class="ul">Apparatus</span><br>
     Radio, motor, cable, and earplug<br>
    <span class="ul">Procedure</span></p>
    <ol class="noli">
      <li>Connect a cable to the motor and radio.</li>
      <li>Raise volume to the maximum.</li>
      <li>Put in an earplug.</li>
      <li>Touch the motor to the head: just in front of one’s ears, behind the ears, at the temple, and at the cheekbone.</li>
      <li>Test someone and make a chart.</li>
      <li>Repeat with 5 more participants.</li>
    </ol><br>

        <h5>temple</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="sbox">Most people feel that just in front of one’s ear is the best placement to listen with. Behind the ear is also a good placement, too. However, the temple and cheekbone are not good placements.</p><br>
  
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <img id="stemimg" class="stem" src="head.png">
    <p id="com" class="stem"> The temporal bone contains the inner ear, so just in front of one’s ear and behind the ear are good placements for hearing. Also, the skull is made by 8 bones, so other places have joints. Therefore they absorb the vibrations.</p><br>

<h2><span class="tul">Second Experiment</span></h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p class="sbox"> What material is the best for making bone conduction hearing aids?</p><br>

<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p class="sbox">When we make hearing aids, iron is the best material to use because most headphones are made with metals.</p><br>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<section class="sbox">
<p><span class="ul">Apparatus</span><br> Radio, motor, cable, acrylic, wood, iron, paper, cup, Adobe Audition <br>
<span class="ul">Procedure</span></p>

<ol class="noli">
  <li>Cut the acrylic, wood, iron, and paper to the same size.</li>
  <li>Connect the piece of material to the end of the motor and connect to the cup to the other side.</li>
  <li>Measure how loud it is.</li>
  <li>Repeat with all of the materials.</li>
</ol><br>

<p>0dB is the loudest volume in this app.<br>
That's the maximum volume that won't cause sound crackling.</p><br>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p class="sbox">I thought that iron is the best material to make hearing aids with, but acrylic is the loudest in these results.<br>
If the density is high, it makes the sound louder, so I measured the density but in the results, iron is the densest. Therefore, sound is not only affected by material density.</p><br>

<h2>Conclution</h2>
<p class="sbox">I learned the mechanism of bone conduction.
I asked my grandmother, and she said, “When I put a motor on my ear with better hearing, it is better than the ear with worse hearing.” So I think it is difficult to solve the problem because most deafness is caused by the inner ear. <br> I wanted to ask many people, but I couldn’t because of COVID-19, so after COVID-19 is over, I’ll ask many people.</p>
